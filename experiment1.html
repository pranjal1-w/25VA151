    <h2>HTML</h2>

    <p>
        <i>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web.
 It defines the structure and meaning of web pages by using elements, commonly known as tags, to enclose and format text, images, links, and other media.
 These elements are delineated by tags written using angle brackets, such as for headings and for paragraphs.
 HTML is the foundational building block of the web, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</i>

    <h2>
        CSS 
    </h2>
    <p>
        <i>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.
 It enables the separation of content (structured with HTML) from its visual design, allowing control over layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness across different devices.
 CSS works by applying rules to HTML elements through selectors, with styles cascading in a hierarchical order based on specificity and source order.
 This separation improves maintainability, enhances performance through reusable style files, and supports responsive design using tools like media queries and Flexbox.</i>

        JAVA SCRIPT 
    </h2>
    <p>
        <i>
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive content on web pages.
 It is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, and is used to manipulate webpage content through the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user interactions, and enable real-time updates without requiring full page reloads.
 Originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 as LiveScript, it was renamed JavaScript to leverage the popularity of Java at the time.
 JavaScript is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and object-oriented programming styles, and is now used not only in web browsers but also on servers via runtimes like Node.js, Deno, and Bun.
